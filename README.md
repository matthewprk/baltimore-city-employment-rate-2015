# baltimore-city-employment-rate-2015
## Background
Explored how accurately Baltimore City's employment rate can be predicted by variables: job density, job growth, poverty rate, median HH income, and commute time. Interested in this problem because Baltimore City is experiencing similar but worse employment trends over the past few years. If Baltimore is to address this issue, it's important to understand some of the possible predictors.

Access and/or economic conditions were the variable categories I focused on and they can be addressed to improve Baltimore's employment rate. For example, neighborhoods in poverty receive [1.5x less investment than the average neighborhood in Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0207-baltimore-poverty-20190205-story.html). If there's a significant relationship between poverty and employment rates, then policies like this need to be reconsidered. 
## Business Question
How can Baltimore City's predict and increase its employment rate by examing factors such as job desnity, job growth, poverty rate, median HH income, and commute time?
