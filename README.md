# baltimore-city-employment-rate-2015
## Background
Explored how accurately Baltimore City's employment rate can be predicted by variables: job density, job growth, poverty rate, median HH income, and commute time. Interested in this problem because Baltimore City is experiencing similar but worse employment trends over the past few years.

It's important to explore this problem to determine if access and/or economic conditions can be addressed to improve Baltimore's employment rate. For example, neighborhoods in poverty receive [1.5x less investment than the average neighborhood in Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0207-baltimore-poverty-20190205-story.html). If there's a significant relationship between poverty and employment rates, then policies like these need to be reconsidered.
